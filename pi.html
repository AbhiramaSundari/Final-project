    <h1 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I dont have any special hobbies.</p> 
    <p>I am a big time movie freak. I usually watch all kind of movies and all regional language movies.I usually love rom-com , emotional movies and sometimes i do love to watch thrillers when i am in a group.</p>
    <p>And i also love to read books. Mostly i read books from my mother tongue tamil. Sometimes i read english books and my favorite books are Agatha christie's. Though her books are almost 100 years old, still i can feel that it is very interesting and thrilling to read them. </p>
    <p>And my language tamil also has the best books. I love to read them often and i have stocked my book shelf with tamil books all the way from India. I just read them whenever i feel like.</p>

    <p>Being a lover of my mother tongue, i always wanted to teach my language to kids. So i had the opportunity to join together with the like minded people as me and formed a school which operates on saturday. </p>
    <p>It was a great pleasure to teach the kids and see them progress as days pass. It is situated in Neuperlach sud and the classes are from 10-12.30pm</p>
    <p>Here is a small glimpse.</p>

        <p>I always had the passion of becoming a video jockey and got the opportunity to start a youtube channel with few friends here . It was named as "vettikootam" meaning people who doesnt have anything to do &#128518. </p>
        <p>It had videos in my own mother tongue where i paired with one of my friends and did few videos.</p>
        <p>We decided to take a tour around Munich and explain people the history behind each place in Munich and got an know more interesting things about Munich. We loved to shoot early in the morning during summer so that we will have enough sun light.</p>
        <p>And we also made videos on how to get visas for tourist and family reunions and also published important news in Munich</p>
        <p>But we couldn't continue further as everyone got busy with their work and the weather also was not favorable. planning to continue it as soon as we just get settled in our respective places.</p>
        <p>And here is also a small glimpse on some of our videos</p>
