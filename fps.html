            <p style="font-family: 'Philosopher', sans-serif; font-size=25px;">I did my bachelors in B.Tech Energy and Environmental Engineering from 2009-2013.</p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Philosopher', sans-serif; font-size=25px;">The course focused on two important subjects viz.,
                <ul style="font-family: 'Philosopher', sans-serif; font-size=25px;">
               <li>  Energy production, conservation, management, energy auditing and budgeting </li>
               <br>
                <li>Science of environmental pollution, causes of pollution and pollution remediation engineering.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The job markets are renewable and non renewable energy sectors, pollution remediation sectors, energy auditing and budgeting.</li>
                <br>
                <li>We also had a lot of company visits and an All India trip visiting the major companies in whole of India.</li>
                <br>
                <li>We also had an compulsary internship for a period of 3 months and was awarded a certificate for the same. And also during the semester holidays , we managed to find internship in few companies</li>
                <br>
                <li>And then the last program was the village stay, where we had to stay in a village for a period of 15 days where we did a survey about their living there. And it was amazing experience for me as the village life was entirely different.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Philosopher', sans-serif; font-size=25px;">This sums up my whole bachelors studies</p>

        <h2 id= "weiterbildung">Weiterbildung</h2>
        <p>After acquring good german skills i had an opportunity to make a weiterbildung with the help of Bundesamt.The weiterbildung was "Energiemanagement Beauftragter with DEKRA certificate.</p>
        <p>Released in June 2011, the new ISO 50001:2018 has a High-Level Structure (HLS) and is based on the quality standard ISO 9001 and the environmental standard ISO 14001. This enables organizations to convert their existing energy and environmental management systems into a systematic energy management system:
<ul>
           <li> Development of a company policy for the more efficient use of energy</li>
           <li>Determination of characteristic values</li>
            <li>Data analysis of energy consumption in all major consumption areas</li>
            <li> Measurement of results</li>
            <li> monitoring of measures</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The benefits you get from the ISO 50001 certification
        <ul>
       <li> Competitive advantages through higher efficiency and lower energy costs</li>
        
        <li> economic efficiency due to lower energy consumption</li>
        
        <li></li>Detailed breakdown of energy consumption in the compan</li>
        
        <li></li>Identification of potential savings in the energy sector</li>
        
        <li></li>Reduction of CO2 emissions</li>
        
        Conformity with energy policy</li>
        
        Systematic improvement of processes</li>
        
        Stronger awareness of energy efficiency among employees and management</li>
    </ul>
